📊 Grade Calculator  
*A Swift App Case Study*

## 🧾 Overview  
Grade Calculator is a basic iOS app that allows users to input student grades and instantly view a percentage breakdown. It also includes a visual bar graph to help interpret overall performance.

- Users input how many students there are and assign a grade to each.
- Once calculated, the app shows the percentage of students who received each grade.
- A bar graph provides a clear, color-coded visual breakdown of grade distribution.

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Language**: Swift  
- **Platform**: iOS
